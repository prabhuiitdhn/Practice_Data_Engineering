## This repository for understanding the Data Engineering.
Each folder explains how to work with data.
  1. **Data sources**: It helps to understand the types of data format which might come across with in Machine Learning Projects.
  2. **Data clearning**: It helps to understand the data and what are irrelevant things we needs to remove for improving the model prediction.
  3. **Data preprocessing**: It helps to preprocess the data is one of most important and challenging job we do when we work with modeling.
  4. **Feature extraction**: It helps to extract the important features in the data.
  5. **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Once we have data ready, then we need to have ml pipeline to train & test the model.

 All the folder contains the readMe which explains the concepts in high level with implementation in pycharm.
